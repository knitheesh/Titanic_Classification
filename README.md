# Project Title:

Titanic Survival Prediction System

# Problem Statement:

The sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912 was a tragic event that resulted in a significant loss of life. This project aims to develop a machine learning system that predicts whether a person aboard the Titanic would have survived the disaster based on various factors. The primary goal is to identify the most influential factors that led to survival, such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more.

# Description:
The Titanic Survival Prediction System utilizes a dataset containing passenger information, including socio-economic class (Pclass), age, gender, family size, ticket fare, and more.

# Conclusion:

Summarize the project's findings and key results.
Highlight the factors that were most likely to lead to survival on the Titanic.
Discuss the machine learning model's accuracy and its ability to predict survival based on passenger information.
Emphasize the importance of understanding historical events like the Titanic disaster through data analysis and predictive modeling.
